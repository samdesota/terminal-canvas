# terminal-canvas

A little experiment to play with alternative window mangement strategies. It's a infinite canvas, and you can create as many terminal windows as you want with it. Trying to understand if an infinite scrollable canvas makes a good desktop, instead of having lots of windows crammed into a small space. If you use mostly terminal based applications you can use it as your window manager.

You can use your trackpad / wheel to shift around the canvas. You can move windows, and resize them by using the little red square in the bottom of the window. To create a new terminal window, just click anywhere on the canvas.
