# terminal-canvas

A little experiment I did to play with alternative window managemnet strategies. It's a infinite canvas, and you can create as many terminal windows as you want with it.

You can use your trackpad / wheel to shift around teh canvas. You can move and resize the windows as well. To create a new terminal window, just click anywhere on the canvas.
